🏎️ RideRight AI – Intelligent Auto Sales Chatbot

RideRight AI is a smart, AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users in selecting the perfect car based on their preferences, 
budget, and brand interests. Built as part of a final-year Software Engineering coursework, the project combines natural language processing,
machine learning, and a structured knowledge base to simulate a realistic auto sales assistant.
